        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " -   OOP models programs as interacting objects that bundle data and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "-   A class is a blueprint defining attributes and methods for its objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - An object is an instantiated version of a class holding its own data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " -  Abstraction hides complexity; encapsulation protects internal state by controlling access.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Special double-underscore methods (like `__init__`, `__repr__`) that define Python’s built-in behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "  - A mechanism allowing a class to derive functionality from a parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "   - Different object types implementing the same interface or method name.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "   - Using `_` and `__` name conventions and properties to control attribute access.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "   - `__init__` initializes the instance; `__new__` creates it.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods?\n",
        "   - Class methods receive the class (`cls`); static methods receive no implicit argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "    Python lacks true signature-based overloading; emulate with default parameters or `*args/**kwargs`.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding?\n",
        "   - A subclass replaces a parent method with its own implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator?\n",
        " -   `@property` creates a managed attribute with optional setter/deleter.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important?\n",
        "    It lets different objects be used through a shared interface, lowering coupling.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  -  A class defined using `abc.ABC` with abstract methods requiring subclass implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  -  Modularity, reuse, abstraction, encapsulation, easier maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Difference between class variable and instance variable?\n",
        "  -  Class variables are shared across all instances; instance variables are unique to each one.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance?\n",
        "  -  A class inheriting from more than one parent; Python resolves conflicts via the MRO.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__`?\n",
        "  -  `__repr__` is unambiguous/debug-friendly; `__str__` is user-friendly.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Significance of `super()`?\n",
        "  -  It calls methods from the next class in the MRO, enabling cooperative inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. Significance of `__del__`?\n",
        " -   It runs on object destruction but is unreliable for resource cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. Difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`?\n",
        " -   Static methods take no implicit arguments; class methods take the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work with inheritance?\n",
        "  -  Python resolves method calls at runtime, so overridden methods run based on object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining?\n",
        "-    Methods return `self` so calls can be chained like `obj.f().g()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Purpose of `__call__`?\n",
        "  -  Makes an instance callable like a function.\n",
